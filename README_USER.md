## 🚀 How to Complete the Setup

### Step 1: Create the Database

Open Terminal and run this command:

```bash
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS lensf7 CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
```

💡 **Tip**: If you have a MySQL password, add `-p` flag:
```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS lensf7 CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
```

### Step 2: Copy Configuration File

The config.php file has been created with the correct database name. Copy it to your web directory:

```bash
cp /path/to/this/repo/config.php /opt/homebrew/var/www/lensf7/
```

Or if you cloned the repo elsewhere, adjust the path accordingly.

### Step 3: Populate with Death Guild Events (Optional)

Navigate to your web directory and run the seed script:

```bash
cd /opt/homebrew/var/www/lensf7
php database/seed.php
```

This creates:
- 🏢 **DNA Lounge** venue
- 🎵 **Death Guild events** for the next 4 Mondays
  - Time: 9:30 PM - 2:00 AM every Monday
  - Tags: #goth #industrial #DeathGuild
- 🎸 **The Fillmore** and **The Chapel** sample venues

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "mysql: command not found"
Install MySQL or MariaDB:
```bash
brew install mysql
# OR
brew install mariadb
```

### "Access denied for user 'root'"
Edit `config.php` and set your MySQL password:
```php
define('DB_PASS', 'your_password_here');
```

### Database still shows "Unknown database"
Make sure you:
1. Created the database (Step 1 above)
2. Copied config.php to the correct location (Step 2)
3. Reloaded the page in your browser
