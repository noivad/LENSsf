Local Event Network Service

This website—when completed—will allow users to create events, add events to their calendar, define the location/venue and act as a venue owner, have deputies for both venues and events where they can take care of most administration. The site will all users to upload photos, coment on photos, and share events with other users. 

I'm trying to make this really staightforward and simple. So, I’m using php since it's the most straight forward language, without a lot of the JS gotchas that take days to debug. 

This is being done via vibe coding, with manual changes where the AI gets it wrong.
