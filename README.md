Local Event Network Service

This website—when completed—will allow users to create events, add events to their calendar, define the location/venue, upload photos, coment on photos. I'm trying to make this really staightforward and simple. So, I’m using php since it's the most straight forward language, without a lot of the JS gotchas that take days to debug. 

This is being done via vibe coding, with manual changes where the AI gets it wrong.
