## Overview
This task implemented several new features and pages for the Local Event Network Service (LENS) application, focusing on venue management, event listing, tag filtering, and user account management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tags Page (`public/tags.php`)
- **Purpose**: Lists all event tags with a '#' prefix

  - Search functionality with #tag syntax (comma-delimited)
  - Click tags to filter events by that tag
  - Selected tags can be removed individually
  - "Clear All Filters" button to reset and show all upcoming events

### 2. Event List Page (`public/event-list.php`)
- **Purpose**: Lists all upcoming events with filtering capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Shows all upcoming events (from today onwards)
  - Filterable by tags via URL parameter (?tags=music,art)
  - Tags displayed below event title, before description and date
  - Each tag is clickable to filter by that tag
  - Active filter badges with ability to remove individual filters
  - Shows event image, description, date, time, venue, and owner

### 3. Account Page (`public/account.php`)
- **Purpose**: User profile and content management
- **Features**:
  - **Profile Settings**:
    - Edit name (updates session)
    - Edit email
    - Change password (requires double entry for confirmation)
  - **My Events Section**:

    - Shows event image, description preview, date, time
    - Displays photo count for each event
  - **My Photos Section**:
    - Grid display of all photos uploaded by the user

    - Ability to add comments to photos
    - Ability to delete own photos (with confirmation)
    - Displays existing comments on each photo
  - **Statistics**:
    - Total events created
    - Total photos uploaded

### 4. Venue Info Page Updates
- Already existed as `public/venue-info.php` (no conversion from .html needed)
- Updated navigation to include new pages

### 5. Navigation Updates
Updated navigation across all pages to include:
- Home
- Events (links to event-list.php)
- Calendar (links to calendar-7x5.php)
- Venues (links to venue-info.php)
- Tags (links to tags.php)
- Account (links to account.php)
- Add Event (links to add-event.php) - placed last in navigation

Files with updated navigation:
- `public/index.php`
- `public/venue-info.php`
- `public/add-event.php`
- `public/calendar-7x5.php`
- `public/tags.php`
- `public/event-list.php`
- `public/account.php`

### 6. Helper Functions Added
Added to `includes/helpers.php`:
- `autoloadSession()`: Ensures session is started
- `ensureSiteName()`: Ensures SITE_NAME constant is defined

## Technical Details

### Database Integration
- Uses existing schema with events, venues, photos, and photo_comments tables
- Tags stored as JSON in events.tags column
- Photos linked to events via event_id foreign key
- Comments stored in photo_comments table

### Session Management
- Current user stored in `$_SESSION['current_user']`
- Flash messages used for user feedback
- Profile updates modify session data

### Security Features
- Password confirmation required for password changes
- Photo deletion limited to photo owner
- All user input sanitized via `e()` helper function
- Form submissions use POST with action parameters

### Styling
- Consistent with existing application design
- Uses CSS custom properties for theming
- Responsive grid layouts
- Hover effects and transitions for better UX

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test tag filtering with multiple tags
2. Verify password double-entry validation
3. Test photo upload and comment functionality
4. Verify navigation links work across all pages
5. Test event filtering by tag from tags.php
6. Ensure proper display of events with and without images
7. Test photo deletion with confirmation

## Notes
- venue-info.html was already converted to venue-info.php in a previous task
- All pages maintain consistent navigation structure
- The application uses a simple session-based "current user" system
- No authentication system is currently implemented (uses demo users)
