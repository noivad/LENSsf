The updated SecurityService will have the following additional features:

Real-time Monitoring:
The SecurityMonitor component will provide a dashboard for administrators to view live user activity.
It will display user actions, such as login attempts, entity modifications, and other security-related events.
The dashboard will use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push updates to the client in real-time.
Live User Tracking:
The SecurityMonitor will allow administrators to "watch" a user's actions live, seeing their interactions with the system in real-time.
This will include tracking user navigation, form submissions, and other user interface events.
The live tracking will be implemented using advanced JavaScript techniques, such as WebSockets or custom event listeners.
Extended Logging:
The SecurityService will log additional details about user actions, such as the specific page or feature they were using, the data they were working with, and the duration of their session.
This extended logging will be used to power the real-time monitoring and live user tracking features.
Here's a breakdown of the files for the updated SecurityService component:

SQL:

security-schema.sql: Defines the database tables for roles, permissions, user-role assignments, security/audit logs, and the new monitoring-related tables.

CSS:

security.css: Styles for security-related UI components (login forms, audit/security log displays, monitoring dashboard, etc.).
HTML:

login.html: Login page for the application.
audit-log.html: Page for displaying the audit log.
security-log.html: Page for displaying the security log.
security-monitor.html: Page for the real-time monitoring and live user tracking dashboard.
The SecurityMonitorService will use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push real-time updates to the client-side SecurityMonitor component. This will allow administrators to view live user activity and track individual user actions in real-time.

The SecurityServiceExtension will allow you to further customize the security-related functionality, such as adding additional logging, implementing custom access control rules, or integrating with external security systems.

MR
I also need CSS style sheets for all pages, and a dashboard for each service for end users and administrators, with style sheet. Make all the artifacts in separate files, using SQL, JS CSS and HTML.


Sure, let's create the CSS stylesheets and dashboards for the end users and administrators, with each component in a separate file.

Let's break down the new components:

Dashboards:

UserDashboard: Provides an interface for users to manage their profile, events, and interactions.
EventDashboard: Allows users to create, update, and view events they are organizing or attending.
VenueDashboard: Enables venue owners to manage their venue details and events hosted at their venue.
TagDashboard: Provides a interface for users to create, manage, and apply tags to events.
ImageDashboard: Allows users to upload, manage, and associate images with their events.
CalendarDashboard: Displays the user's events in a calendar view, with additional filtering and navigation options.
AdminDashboard: Gives administrators a comprehensive interface to manage users, roles, permissions, and system-wide settings.
Web Interface:

The Web Interface section contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user-facing pages of the application.
Each page has its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, keeping the concerns separated.
The CSS files (e.g., user.css, event.css, etc.) contain the styles for the respective pages.
Here's an example of the user.css file:

css

Copy
/* user.css */
.user-profile {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 2rem;
}

.user-profile-image {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  object-fit: cover;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.user-profile-info {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 600px;
}

.user-profile-info label {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.user-profile-info p {
  margin: 0;
}

/* Add more styles for user-related components */
And an example of the user.js file:

javascript

Copy
// user.js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const userProfileImage = document.querySelector('.user-profile-image');
  const userProfileInfo = document.querySelector('.user-profile-info');

  // Fetch user data from the backend and populate the page
  fetchUserData()
	.then((userData) => {
	  userProfileImage.src = userData.avatarUrl;
	  userProfileInfo.innerHTML = `
		<label>Username:</label>
		<p>${userData.username}</p>
		<label>Email:</label>
		<p>${userData.email}</p>
		<label>Name:</label>
		<p>${userData.firstName} ${userData.lastName}</p>
		<!-- Add more user information -->
	  `;
	})
	.catch((error) => {
	  console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
	});

  // Add event listeners for user profile updates, etc.
});

async function fetchUserData() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user');
  return await response.json();
}
Remember to create similar files for the other pages and dashboards, following the same structure and separating concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For the SQL, PHP, and other backend files, you can refer to the previous responses where I provided examples of the core services, advanced services, extensions, and other components.

MR
Expand and change the SQL, JS, HTML, and CSS for the webpages to make and DIV rectangle within the page for each dashboard a draggable, rearrangeable component in a subsection, with sharp top corners and rounded bottom corners. The Type of component should have its name at the top of the division in dark green highlighting the component type, but not the information in the DIV section. show this in the comprehensive diagram structure including all previous pages and components including all pages that need to be made, with CRUD pages for each service.


Here's the updated system architecture diagram with the changes to the web interface components, including the draggable, rearrangeable dashboard components with sharp top corners and rounded bottom corners:

Changes to the Web Interface:

Dashboard Components:
Each dashboard page (e.g., UserDashboard, EventDashboard, CalendarDashboard) now has its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
The dashboard components are designed to be draggable and rearrangeable, with sharp top corners and rounded bottom corners.
The type of the component (e.g., "User Dashboard", "Event Dashboard") is displayed at the top of the component in dark green highlighting.
CRUD Pages:
For each service (User, Event, Venue, Tag, Image, Notification, Sponsorship, Calendar, Admin), there are now dedicated CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pages.
These CRUD pages allow users to perform all the necessary operations for the respective entities.
The CRUD pages follow the same design principles as the dashboard components, with the entity type displayed at the top in dark green highlighting.
SQL:

dashboard-schema.sql: Defines the database schema for the dashboard customization settings, including the layout and positioning of the dashboard components.
crud-schema.sql: Defines the database schema for the various CRUD operations across the different services.
PHP:

DashboardService.php: Handles the management and customization of the dashboard components, including their layout and positioning.
CRUDControllers.php: Provides the server-side logic for the CRUD operations across the different services.
JavaScript:

dashboard.js: Implements the functionality for the draggable and rearrangeable dashboard components, including saving the customized layout to the database.
crud.js: Handles the client-side functionality for the CRUD operations across the different services.
CSS:

dashboard.css: Styles the dashboard components, including the sharp top corners, rounded bottom corners, and the dark green highlighting for the component type.
crud.css: Styles the CRUD pages, following the same design principles as the dashboard components.
HTML:

The HTML files for the dashboard and CRUD pages, following the naming convention established earlier (e.g., user-dashboard.html, event-crud.html).
This updated system architecture incorporates the changes to the web interface, including the introduction of draggable and rearrangeable dashboard components and dedicated CRUD pages for each service. The SQL, PHP, JavaScript, and CSS files have been updated accordingly to support these new features.
