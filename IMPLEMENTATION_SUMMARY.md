### 7. Database Migrations

#### Migration Files Created
- `001_add_venue_privacy_fields.sql`: Adds is_private and is_public to venues
- `002_add_event_recurrence_fields.sql`: Adds recurrence fields to events
- `003_add_user_profile_table.sql`: Creates user_profiles table

#### Migration Script
- `database/run_migrations.php`: Executable script to run migrations
- Supports idempotent operations
- Error handling with detailed output

## Recurrence Pattern Structure

Events store recurrence patterns as JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "weekly|monthly_day|monthly_date|custom",
  "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "interval": 1,
  "week": "first|second|third|fourth|last",
  "day_of_week": "monday|tuesday|...",
  "unit": "days|weeks|months"
}
```

### Examples

**Weekly (every 2 weeks):**
```json
{
  "type": "weekly",
  "interval": 2,
  "end_date": "2024-12-31"
}
```

**Monthly (2nd Tuesday every month):**
```json
{
  "type": "monthly_day",
  "week": "second",
  "day_of_week": "tuesday",
  "interval": 1,
  "end_date": null
}
```

**Custom (every 3 days):**
```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "interval": 3,
  "unit": "days",
  "end_date": "2024-06-30"
}
```

## Privacy System

### Venue Privacy Levels

1. **Public Venue** (is_private=FALSE, is_public=TRUE)
   - Default for regular venues
   - Visible to all users
   - Can be used by anyone for events

2. **Private Custom Venue** (is_private=TRUE, is_public=FALSE)
   - Created for specific addresses (e.g., homes)
   - Only visible to owner
   - Can be made public by owner

3. **Public Custom Venue** (is_private=TRUE, is_public=TRUE)
   - Started as private but made public by owner
   - Visible to all users
   - Retains private flag for tracking

## Navigation Updates

- Updated main navigation to link to `venues-list.php`
- Maintained consistent navigation across all pages
- Active page highlighting preserved

## Usage Guide

### Creating an Event with Recurrence

1. Navigate to "Add Event"
2. Fill in basic event details (title, date, description)
3. Select or create a venue
4. Check "Recurring Event"
5. Choose recurrence type:
   - Weekly: Set interval in weeks
   - Monthly (day): Select week and day (e.g., "2nd Tuesday")
   - Monthly (date): Set interval for same date each month
   - Custom: Specify custom interval and unit
6. Optionally set an end date
7. Click "Create Event"

### Creating a Private Venue

1. Navigate to "Create Venue"
2. Fill in venue details
3. Check "This is a private/custom venue"
4. Submit to create
5. Venue will be private by default
6. Visit venue detail page to toggle public visibility

### Managing Venue Images

1. Navigate to venue detail page
2. Click "Upload Image" under existing image
3. Select image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP up to 10MB)
4. Submit to update

## Technical Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- All manager classes check for column existence before using new fields
- Old databases will function without new columns (with limited features)
- Migration system allows incremental updates

### Security Considerations
- File uploads validated for type and size
- Filenames sanitized to prevent path traversal
- Database operations use prepared statements
- HTML output escaped with `e()` function

### Performance
- Images optimized during upload
- Database queries use appropriate indexes
- Lazy loading for venue/event lists
