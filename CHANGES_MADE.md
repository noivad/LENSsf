- PDO MySQL extension
- GD or Imagick for image handling

### Optional
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)
- Composer (for future dependency management)

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are additive and backward compatible:
- New columns have default values
- Column existence is checked before use
- Old code continues to function
- Migrations can be run incrementally

## Migration Path

### For New Installations
1. Use updated `schema_mysql.sql`
2. All tables created with new columns
3. Ready to use immediately

### For Existing Installations
1. Run `php database/run_migrations.php`
2. New columns added to existing tables
3. Existing data preserved
4. New features available immediately

## Code Quality

### Standards Followed
- PHP 8.1+ strict types
- PSR-12 coding style
- Prepared statements (SQL injection prevention)
- HTML escaping (XSS prevention)
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Type hints
- Documentation

### Security Measures
- File upload validation
- MIME type checking
- Filename sanitization
- Size limits
- Prepared statements
- HTML output escaping
- Path traversal prevention

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Database indexes on key columns
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Single query for list views
- Efficient JSON storage
- Image file organization

### Scalability
- Pagination ready (not implemented yet)
- Search ready (not implemented yet)
- Caching ready (not implemented yet)
- API ready (structure in place)

## Known Limitations

1. **No event occurrence generation** - Recurrence patterns stored but not expanded
2. **No date validation** - Monthly patterns may create invalid dates
3. **No recurrence exceptions** - Can't skip specific occurrences
4. **No image optimization** - Large images stored as-is
5. **No pagination** - All venues/events loaded at once
6. **No search** - Basic filtering not implemented

## Future Enhancements Suggested

1. Generate event occurrences from recurrence patterns
2. Calendar integration showing recurring events
3. Image thumbnail generation
4. Advanced search and filtering
5. Pagination for large lists
6. Event templates
7. Bulk operations
8. Export functionality (iCal, etc.)
9. Email notifications
10. Mobile app API

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Do existing events break with this update?**
A: No, all changes are backward compatible. Existing events will have is_recurring=FALSE.

**Q: Can I migrate an existing database?**
A: Yes, run `php database/run_migrations.php` to add new columns.

**Q: What happens to old venue-info.php?**
A: It still exists but navigation now points to venues-list.php. Can be removed if desired.

**Q: How are images stored?**
A: Filesystem in /public/uploads/ with database paths. Images are not stored in DB.

**Q: Can users delete their uploads?**
